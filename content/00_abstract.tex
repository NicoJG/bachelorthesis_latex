\section*{Abstract} %TODO
The precise measurements needed to further test the Standard Model of particle physics produce great amounts of data with complex patterns.
Machine learning algorithms are commonly used to support the analysis of this data.
A classification algorithm is developed in this thesis for the distinction between uncharged $B_d$ and $B_s$ mesons in $pp$-collisions.
This algorithm uses data measured by the LHCb detector of the associated event to the signal $B$ meson without data of the signal decay. %TODO: of or on?
The chosen strategy is to first identify \enquote{same side} tracks using a Boosted Decision Tree classifier and then use the output of this classifier in a DeepSet classifier to identify the type of signal $B$ meson.
The achieved ROC AUC on simulated data is $0.739$.
Tests of the developed algorithm on \enquote{real} LHCb data yields inconclusive results.
These tests are performed using fits of $B$ mass distributions after selections based on the DeepSet output.

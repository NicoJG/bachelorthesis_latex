\section{The LHC}

The LHC (Large Hadron Collider) is a $\qty{27}{\km}$ long ring accelerator located at border of France and Switzerland. 
It is the largest particle accelerator in the world, and it is managed by CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Geneva.
In it, protons collide with a center-of-mass energy of $\qty{14}{\TeV}$ and lead ions collide with an energy of $\qty{2.8}{\TeV}$ per nucleon \cite{LHC}.
The four largest detectors at the LHC are ATLAS\cite{ATLAS}, CMS\cite{CMS}, ALICE\cite{ALICE} and LHCb\cite{LHCb}.
While ATLAS and CMS are general-purpose particle detectors, ALICE is dedicated to heavy ion collisions resulting in a quark-gluon plasma, and LHCb is dedicated to $pp$ collisions involving $c$ or $b$ quarks.

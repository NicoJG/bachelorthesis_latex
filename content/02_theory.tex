\section{The Standard Model of particle physics}

To classify particles with different properties and quantify the interactions between those particles, physicists developed a construct of theories known as the Standard Model of particle physics.
It is based on quantum field theory which itself is the generalization of quantum mechanics to include special relativity and classical field theory.

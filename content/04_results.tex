\chapter[Development of the \texorpdfstring{$B$}{B} meson classifier]{Development of the \texorpdfstring{$\symbf{B}$}{B} meson classifier}

The goal of this thesis is to develop an algorithm that can distinguish $B_d$ mesons from $B_s$ mesons produced in $pp$-collisions.
This algorithm is intended to be independent of the signal decay channel. 
Therefore, it only uses data of the associated event excluding tracks from the signal decay.
As mentioned in \cref{sec:B_mesons}, only the SS is expected to contain relevant information.
Thus, every track in the dataset is assigned an estimated probability of being a SS track by a BDT before classifying the signal~$B$ using a DeepSet.

This chapter describes in detail the methods and results of training this $B$ meson classifier.
The first section explains the choice of the training dataset.
Then the training of a BDT for SS track classification is presented.
The following section describes the training of a DeepSet for $B$ meson classification.
In the last section, the trained model is tested on LHCb data.

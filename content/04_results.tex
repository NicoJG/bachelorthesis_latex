\chapter{Methods and results}

% Belongs in the methodology chapter:
% The aim of this thesis is to distinguish $B_d$ and $B_s$ mesons without information about the signal decay.
% This means it is irrelevant which quarks are antiquarks, and it is expected that only information about the same side is relevant here.

The goal of this thesis is to develop an algorithm that can distinguish $B_d$ mesons from $B_s$ mesons produced in $pp$-collisions.
This algorithm should be independent of the signal decay channel and therefore only uses data on the associated event.
As mentioned in \autoref{sec:B_mesons}, only the SS fragmentation is expected to contain relevant information.
Thus, before classifying the signal $B$, every track in the associated event is assigned an estimated probability of being a SS fragmentation track.

This chapter describes the methods and results of developing the mentioned algorithm.

\section{The datasets}

All datasets used in this thesis originate from the LHCb collaboration.
For the training of machine learning models, simulated data of the LHCb detector is used.
These models are then applied to real data from the LHCb detector to verify the performance of the models.

(describe the simulation)...

The raw detector data has already been fed through a processing pipeline to generate multiple different features about the particles of an event.
